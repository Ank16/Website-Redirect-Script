# Website-Redirect-Script
Install Python 3.8.6 (add to PATH) and run pip install -r requirements.txt in command line.

Put websites to run in script in data.csv one after another (do NOT delete the WebPage row at the top). Make sure error-log.txt is empty

Run main.py and results will output in results.csv and results.xls and websites that had errors will be in error-log.txt
